# Deployment Instructions for Next.js App with Prisma and AWS S3

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- AWS account with S3 bucket created
- Database setup (SQLite for development, consider PostgreSQL or MySQL for production)
- Vercel account (optional, recommended for easy Next.js deployment)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables in your deployment platform with the following:

```
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db" # or your production database URL
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-key-id"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-access-key"
AWS_REGION="your-aws-region"
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME="your-s3-bucket-name"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-deployment-url.com"
```

## Prisma Setup

1. Run migrations to create database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

2. Generate Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## Local Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment on Vercel

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Import the project in Vercel dashboard
3. Set environment variables in Vercel project settings
4. Deploy the project; Vercel will run build and start the server automatically

## Notes

- Ensure your AWS credentials have permissions for S3 operations
- For production, use a robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of SQLite
- Secure your environment variables and secrets properly
- Monitor logs and errors after deployment for smooth operation
